## Getting up and running

To run this application, please install [Node.js](https://nodejs.org). The safe
option is to install the LTS release.

Next, open a terminal and make sure the command `node -v` works as expected. It
should output the version number.

Then get yourself a copy of this application. It should live in its own
directory.

Open up a terminal and `cd` your way to wherever the application directory is.
In it, run `npm i` to install the application's dependencies. Do not close the
terminal yet, we need it again.

Put your data text file into the directory.

Finally, run `node . filename.txt` in the terminal you opened before. Make sure
to replace `filename.txt` with the actual filename.
